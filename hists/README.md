Sorry this document is not really in markdown, my bad.

Anyhow, you're probably wondering, what the heck are all these .png files?
They're histograms! The naming scheme is task_id --- task_step_index, where the
task id's are defined in crosstask/crostask_release/tasks_primary.txt, and the
task step indices refer to the ordering of the task steps in the same document.
The frequencies are normalized, and represent how often that score was given to
that task step.
